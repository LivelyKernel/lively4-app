# lively4-app
Lively4 to run locally

#### Scripts

if you don't know about yarn [look at this!](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
- `yarn start` - start an electron instance with the lively4-core embedded
- `yarn run dist` - builds a package with additional installer
- `yarn run pack` - builds the app for production

#### Alternative `npm`

you can use all scripts with npm but hopefully you will just use yarn :)
- `npm start`
- `npm run dist`
- `npm run pack`
